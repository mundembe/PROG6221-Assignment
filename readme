EXECUTION FLOW
The application runs in the a loop contained in the main class(execution entry point).
This loop contains a menu which directs the user on what action he/she can take.
The user chooses an option by entering the number which corresponds to the choose in the menu.
Selecting a action run the corresponding method which performs that action then return to the loop, where the user is again presented with the menu.

STORING DATA
The recipe's ingredients and steps are contained in a 2D and 1D array respectively.
As the user inputs data, the arrays are updated, this data can then be recalled to display the recipe.

SCALING QUANTITIES
There is a global variable which is used to scale the proportions of the ingredients.
This scale variable is multiplied to the quantities when the recipe is displayed.
By default, the scale value is set to one, which represents the original proportions. It can be changed to 0.5, 1.5, or 3 in accordance to the user's request.

RESETING QUANTITIES
To reset the quantities of the ingredients, the scale variable is set to 1.

CLEARING DATA
To clear all data, the arrays containing the ingredients and steps are set to empty arrays.
The global variable for the number of steps and ingredients are set to zero.

EXITING THE APPLICATION
To exit the application, the global loop control variable is set to true, which when presented to the main while loop results in a false expression. This causes the program execution to exit the main loop and terminates the application.
